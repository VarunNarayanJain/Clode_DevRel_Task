### What they do
Groundcover is an observability platform focused on providing deep visibility into modern cloud-native systems. It uses eBPF-based instrumentation to collect logs, metrics, and traces with low overhead, helping teams understand system behavior and troubleshoot issues in production.

### Target user (ICP)
DevOps engineers, SRE teams, and platform teams operating Kubernetes and cloud-native workloads who need high-fidelity observability and faster incident diagnosis.

### Key features
- eBPF-based observability for cloud-native systems  
- Unified view of logs, metrics, and traces  
- Kubernetes-native monitoring and troubleshooting  
- Low-overhead data collection  
- Focus on production debugging and root-cause analysis  

### Pricing
Commercial SaaS offering (pricing not publicly listed).

### Positioning
Groundcover positions itself as a modern observability platform built for cloud-native environments, emphasizing deep visibility with minimal performance impact.

### Overlap with Clode
- Both operate in the later stages of the SDLC, particularly during operation and monitoring  
- Both aim to reduce the time and effort required to understand production issues  
- Both are used by DevOps and SRE teams responsible for system reliability  

### How Clode is different
- Groundcover focuses on observing and understanding system behavior, while Clode focuses on automating operational and infrastructure workflows  
- Groundcover helps teams identify what is happening in production, but does not take action on infrastructure or deployments  
- Clode positions itself as moving beyond visibility into automation, reducing the need for manual intervention after issues are identified  

### DevRel angle
When discussing observability tools, Clode can acknowledge that visibility is essential for running reliable systems, while highlighting that insight alone does not reduce operational workload. Clode can be positioned as complementing observability by automating the actions teams repeatedly take after problems are detected.

### Content hooks
1. “Observability tells you what’s wrong. Automation determines how quickly you recover.”  
2. “Seeing the problem is step one — removing manual fixes is step two.”
