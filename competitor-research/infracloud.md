### What they do
InfraCloud is a cloud infrastructure and DevOps-focused company that helps organizations design, deploy, and operate scalable systems, primarily around Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies. Their work combines engineering services, tooling, and best practices to help teams run production infrastructure reliably.

### Target user (ICP)
Engineering organizations and platform teams adopting Kubernetes and cloud-native architectures, especially those that need expert guidance to design and operate reliable infrastructure.

### Key features
- Kubernetes and cloud-native infrastructure expertise  
- Infrastructure design and deployment support  
- DevOps and SRE best practices implementation  
- Operational support for production environments  
- Tooling and automation aligned with client needs  

### Pricing
Service-based pricing (project or engagement dependent; not publicly listed).

### Positioning
InfraCloud positions itself as a cloud-native and Kubernetes-focused partner that helps teams adopt modern infrastructure practices and operate them reliably in production.

### Overlap with Clode
- Both focus on helping teams deploy and operate applications in the cloud  
- Both aim to reduce operational risk and improve reliability  
- Both operate in the later stages of the SDLC, particularly deployment and operations  

### How Clode is different
- InfraCloud primarily delivers outcomes through engineering services and expertise, whereas Clode focuses on productized automation  
- InfraCloud helps teams design and manage infrastructure, but ongoing operations often remain manual or service-driven  
- Clode positions itself as reducing long-term operational effort by automating recurring DevOps and SRE tasks through software  

### DevRel angle
When discussing this space, Clode can acknowledge that expert services are often necessary during early cloud adoption, but highlight how product-driven automation can reduce long-term dependency on manual operations and external support as systems scale.

### Content hooks
1. “Expert DevOps services get you started — automation keeps you running at scale.”  
2. “As infrastructure grows, repeating manual operations becomes the real bottleneck.”
