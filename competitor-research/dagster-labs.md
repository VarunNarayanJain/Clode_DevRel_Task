### What they do
Dagster Labs builds Dagster, an open-source data orchestration platform used to build, deploy, and operate data pipelines. It helps teams manage how data workflows are defined, executed, monitored, and debugged across different environments.

### Target user (ICP)
Data engineers, data platform teams, and organizations running production data pipelines that require reliability, observability, and operational control.

### Key features
- Data pipeline orchestration and scheduling  
- Strong focus on pipeline observability and debugging  
- Asset-based workflow definitions  
- Local development and production parity  
- Integrations with modern data stacks and cloud services  

### Pricing
Open-source core with paid cloud offerings (Dagster Cloud).

### Positioning
Dagster positions itself as a modern data orchestration platform designed to make data pipelines easier to build, operate, and maintain in production environments.

### Overlap with Clode
- Both operate in the later stages of the SDLC, particularly around deployment, operation, and monitoring  
- Both aim to reduce manual operational effort by providing structured automation  
- Both focus on improving reliability and visibility in production systems  

### How Clode is different
- Dagster is specialized for data workflows and pipeline orchestration, whereas Clode targets broader application and infrastructure automation  
- Dagster helps teams understand and operate data pipelines, but does not manage general cloud infrastructure or application deployments  
- Clode positions itself as an automation layer across multiple workload types, not limited to data systems  

### DevRel angle
When discussing tools like Dagster, Clode can acknowledge the value of specialized platforms for specific workloads while emphasizing that many teams operate a mix of applications, services, and data systems. Clode can be positioned as addressing the operational automation challenges that exist outside narrowly scoped platforms.

### Content hooks
1. “Specialized platforms make operating data pipelines easier — but what about everything else in production?”  
2. “Automation shouldn’t stop at data workflows. Most teams run far more than pipelines.”
