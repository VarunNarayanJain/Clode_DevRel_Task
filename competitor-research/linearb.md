### What they do
LinearB is an engineering analytics platform that helps teams measure and improve software delivery performance. It focuses on analyzing development workflows, pull requests, and deployment data to give visibility into how efficiently teams move code from development to production.

### Target user (ICP)
Engineering managers, platform leaders, and organizations looking to improve developer productivity, delivery speed, and overall SDLC health.

### Key features
- SDLC and DORA metrics tracking  
- Insights into pull requests, code reviews, and deployments  
- Developer workflow analytics and reporting  
- Visibility into bottlenecks across the delivery pipeline  
- Integrations with popular version control and CI tools  

### Pricing
Commercial SaaS offering (pricing not publicly listed).

### Positioning
LinearB positions itself as an engineering productivity and delivery intelligence platform, helping teams understand how software is built and shipped rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

### Overlap with Clode
- Both relate to the later stages of the SDLC and the process of delivering software to production  
- Both are used by teams looking to improve reliability and efficiency in software delivery  
- Both support engineering leaders in understanding and improving delivery outcomes  

### How Clode is different
- LinearB focuses on measuring and analyzing delivery workflows, while Clode focuses on automating deployment, infrastructure, and operational tasks  
- LinearB provides insights into where delays or inefficiencies occur, but does not execute changes in infrastructure or operations  
- Clode positions itself as reducing manual DevOps and SRE effort by automating the work required after issues are identified  

### DevRel angle
When discussing tools like LinearB, Clode can clarify that analytics and metrics help teams understand delivery performance, but do not remove operational work. Clode can be positioned as complementing delivery insights by automating the infrastructure and operational steps that slow teams down.

### Content hooks
1. “Knowing where your delivery slows down is useful — fixing it automatically is better.”  
2. “Metrics explain delivery problems. Automation removes the work behind them.”
