# Clode – DevRel Intern Task

This repository contains my submission for the DevRel / Developer Advocate Intern task at Ainyx Solutions.

The goal of this work is to understand the cloud automation and platform engineering space, analyze relevant competitors, and translate those insights into clear, developer-focused messaging for Clode.

## Repository Structure

- `competitor-research/` – Detailed research and comparison of selected competitors
- `messaging-pack/` – DevRel-ready content (tweets, LinkedIn posts, blog outline)
- `faq-objections/` – Common questions and objections developers may have about Clode
- `summary/` – High-level findings and positioning recommendations

All analysis is based on publicly available information.
